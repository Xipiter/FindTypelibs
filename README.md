Find TypeLibs in PEs
=====
This tool may seem useless at first glance, until you realize
that OleView, AxMan, ComRaider, and virtually every other tool
out there enumerate (and retrieve) TLB for ONLY REGISTERED COM/ACTIVEX
objects. What if you have just the file and need the tlb? This pulls the 
TLB out for you. From there you can use OleView.exe to view the TLB
or save it as a human readable IDL.

To see what it looks like, see the 'screenshots' directory.

This tool Recursively searches for windows executables and sees if they
contain TypeLibs and extracts them.

For more info, please see [this blogpost about it](http://dontstuffbeansupyournose.com/2010/09/16/whohastlb-extracting-typelib-data-from-com-objects/)

1. Run the MS OLEViewer app (Start->Run->oleview.exe). 
2. From there, use File->View Typelib. 
3. In the type library view, just use File->Save As to save it as IDL.
